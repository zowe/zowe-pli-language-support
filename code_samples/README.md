# PL/I code samples

PL/I code samples will go in this fodler

## Rules for providing the code samples

**PL/I source code files and related items should not contain any sensitive information. (E.g.: IP adress, user ID, DSN with user ID as HLQ, etc.).**

Before providing the code sample, please, provide a *sample-file-name*.md with the following contents, related to the PL/I file:
1. PL/I language version the source code is applicable to
2. Compiler used to build the source code / supported by compilers
3. Operating system, where the code is possible to run + the version of the OS
4. Brief inputs and outputs of the program (those are: direct runtime inputs, possible user inputs, compilation options, program compilation results, program run results, etc.)
5. Expected instructions to be highlighted / supported by LSP
